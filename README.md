# Customer Segmentation using DBSCAN

This project performs customer segmentation using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm from `scikit-learn`. The dataset consists of artificial customer data including annual income and spending scores.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

A sample dataset is used with the following fields:
- `Customer_ID`: Unique customer identifier
- `Annual_income`: Yearly income of the customer
- `Spending_Score`: Score assigned based on customer spending behavior

## ðŸ“ˆ DBSCAN Clustering

The DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm groups customers based on the density of data points. It helps in identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes and detecting outliers.
